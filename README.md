# Detecting Political Misinformation Using Fine-Tuned NLP Models

## Overview

This repository presents a project that leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically fine-tuning a BERT model, to detect political misinformation. The project addresses the growing challenge of misinformation across social media and digital platforms, aiming to develop an adaptable solution that can effectively identify misinformation in real-time.

## Problem Statement

The proliferation of political misinformation presents a significant challenge in today's information ecosystem. Traditional detection systems struggle to keep up with the dynamic and subtle nature of misinformation tactics. There is an urgent need for advanced, adaptable solutions that can accurately detect misinformation in real-time across various platforms and formats.

## Project Significance

Political misinformation undermines public trust, influences voter behavior, and distorts democratic processes. This project focuses on developing a robust real-time detection system that can protect public discourse and ensure informed decision-making, ultimately contributing to a healthier democratic process.

## Model Development

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

- **Datasets**:
  - **PolitiFact Dataset**: Contains verified political statements labeled as true or false.
  - **LIAR Dataset**: Includes a diverse set of labeled political statements.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized text formats.
  - **Feature Engineering**: Extracted linguistic features, sentiment scores, and metadata (e.g., speaker context). Created word embeddings to capture semantic information.

### Model Selection and Training

- **Model Choice**: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) was selected for its strong performance in understanding context and semantics.
- **Fine-Tuning**: The pre-trained BERT model was fine-tuned on the LIAR dataset, with a focus on detecting political misinformation.
- **Training Strategy**:
  - Implemented a stratified split to ensure balanced training and testing datasets.
  - Applied cross-validation to validate the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
  - Adjusted hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs for optimal performance.

## Evaluation and Results

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Conducted confusion matrix analysis to identify and address any misclassifications.
- **Model Optimization**: Iteratively improved the model by adjusting hyperparameters and feature engineering. Applied techniques like dropout and regularization to enhance robustness.

### Explainability and Transparency

- **Attention Mechanisms**: Analyzed attention weights in the BERT model to understand how the model focuses on different parts of the input text.
- **Feature Importance**: Evaluated the importance of various features engineered during preprocessing, ensuring the model’s predictions are transparent and interpretable.
- **Model Transparency**: Thoroughly documented the model development process, including data sources, preprocessing steps, and training procedures.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Bias and Fairness**: Ensured the dataset used is diverse and representative to minimize bias. Continuously monitored model predictions to identify and mitigate any bias in the outcomes.
- **Data Privacy**: Maintained strict data privacy protocols to protect sensitive information. Implemented anonymization techniques to ensure no personal data is exposed.
- **Accountability**: Established mechanisms for regular auditing of the model’s performance and ethical compliance. Included provisions for model updates and corrections based on ethical reviews and feedback.
